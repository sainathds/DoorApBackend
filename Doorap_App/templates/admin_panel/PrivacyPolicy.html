<p style="margin-bottom: 0.53cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;"><strong>Vaahac Services</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;"><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">The Services constitute a technology platform/mobile based software application through which the Sender can avail pick-up and delivery service for goods that the Sender wishes to transport&nbsp;</span><strong>(&ldquo;Package&rdquo;)&nbsp;</strong><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">from a predetermined Pick-Up Location&nbsp;</span><strong>(&ldquo;Pick-Up Location&rdquo;)&nbsp;</strong><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">to a predetermined drop-off point&nbsp;</span><strong>(&ldquo;Drop Off Location&rdquo;)&nbsp;</strong><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">to the person as identified by the Sender. The Sender may choose to be the person sending the Goods or could identify such other person who will be the sender of the Goods&nbsp;</span><strong>(&ldquo;Sender&rdquo;)&nbsp;</strong><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">or be the Receiver of such Goods or could identify such other person who will be the Receiver of the Goods&nbsp;</span><strong>(&ldquo;Receiver&rdquo;)</strong><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">, as the case may be.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;"><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">Vaahac will assign a delivery person for providing these Services to you&nbsp;</span><strong>(&ldquo;Commuter&rdquo;)</strong><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">. The&nbsp;Commuter will collect the Goods from the Sender at the Pick-Up Location and deliver them to the Receiver at the Drop Off Location.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;"><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">Vaahac will not be responsible for the loss or damage of the package which was/were damaged, broken, or not fit for transport before the Goods were handed over to the&nbsp;Commuter. Vaahac does not conduct any checks on the Goods, and it is the Sender&rsquo;s&nbsp;responsibility to ensure that the Goods are packed properly before sealing the Goods in the tamper-proof packaging or otherwise. In case due to any circumstance the Commuter handles the Package on the instruction of the Sender/Receiver or otherwise, the same shall not make the Commuter liable for any damage to the contents of the Package or the delivery item.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;"><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">Upon initiation of service via placement of order on any of the Platforms of Vaahac, a&nbsp;unique One Time Password (</span><strong>&ldquo;Security Pin&rdquo;</strong><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">) is created and communicated to both the Sender and the Receiver. Thereafter, once the Goods are handed over by the Sender to the&nbsp;Commuter, the Commuter will Click a picture of the package during the time of pickup of the order.&nbsp;Subsequently, the Commuter, upon reaching the location of the Receiver, will click a picture again at the drop off point signifying its delivery to the Receiver. Vaahac will neither pick up the delivery items from the sender nor deliver the Goods to the Receiver unless the Security Pin provided by the Sender/Receiver respectively matches with the respective package before the order is picked up from the Sender or delivery is made to the Receiver.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;"><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">Vaahac may bypass either/both Security Pin on the Sender&rsquo;s request or an Agreement to the contrary, but will not be liable for any defect/damage/destruction to/of the delivery item(s).</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;"><em><u><strong>Vaahac may at its sole discretion refuse to pick up or deliver goods on any account at any time</strong></u></em><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;"><u>.</u></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;"><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">We do not detain any delivery without any valid reason and ensure our best to deliver untampered Packages within the promised timeframe, however we shall not be liable for a tampered Package or delayed delivery or non-delivery if a <em>force majeure&nbsp;</em>event occurs, or if the Sender is in breach of these Terms or if the Security Pin provided by the Receiver does not match. If the Receiver for whatever reasons is unavailable to collect the Goods, or if a&nbsp;valid Security Pin is not entered at the time of delivery, we will return the Goods to the Sender or the Sender, towards which the Sender shall have to pay such additional fee as may be applicable.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;"><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">Vaahac shall provide updates on the status of delivery via&nbsp;Application Notification. Additionally the Receiver/Sender may be able to track the movement of your Goods through the live-tracking facility available on the Application or otherwise through services provided to Vaahac by third-parties.&nbsp;Though live-tracking may be reliable, it is also prone to inaccuracies due to network issues. Vaahac does not give any assurance with respect to the accuracy of the&nbsp;live-tracking system available on the Application.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;"><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">It is also pointed out that&nbsp;Vaahac does not store delivery items from pickup to delivery location at any point, however, it reserves the right to pick up multiple items along the way, consequently storing items transiently, or transferring items across Commuters at its&nbsp;sole discretion which shall be considered as a part of the Service and agreeing to these Terms shall explicitly give Vaahac the right to transiently store delivery items as well as transfer delivery items across Commuter without inducting any additional liability.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;"><span style="border: none;padding: 0cm;">By giving us the Goods in the Safe Packaging or otherwise, you hereby appoint us as your agent, and as agent solely for the delivery of the Goods to the Receiver. In some instances, local authorities may require additional documentation confirming our appointment. You hereby agree that your confirmation and agreement to these Terms are the confirmation of our appointment as your agent for the limited purpose as set&nbsp;forth above.</span></p>
